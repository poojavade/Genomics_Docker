        * Fixed errors related to pbs://localhost and sge://localhost
          URLs that were caused by a bug in the command-line wrappers.
        
        Version 0.2.6 released 2012-10-25
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        * HOTFIX: credential management for SGE and PBS. both adaptors now 
          iterate over SSH and GSISSH contexts as well as consider usernames
          that are part of the url, e.g., pbs+ssh://ole@lonestar.tacc...
        
        Version 0.2.5 released 2012-10-24
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        * Changed documentation to Sphinx
        * Removed object_type API. Python buildins can be used instead
        * Updates to Filesystem API
        * Added JobDescription.name attribute (as defined in DRMAA)
        * Introduced stateful SSH connection substrate for PBS, SGE, etc
        * Introduced support for GSISSH: pbs+gsissh://, sge+gsissh://
        * Re-implementation of a (more Python-esque) attribute interface
        * Fixed JobID issues, i.e., job.job_id returns 'None' in case the
          job is not running instead of "[serviceurl]-[None]"
        * Introduced dynamic, fault-tolerant plug-in loader. If anything 
          goes wrong during loading of a specific plug-in (i.e., dependencies 
          on 3rd party modules cannot be fulfilled, the plug-in will just get 
          skipped and the remaining ones will still get loaded. Previously, a
          single problem during plug-in loading would take Bliss down.
        
        Version 0.2.4 released 2012-7-10
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------

          looks much cleaner now. Compatibility with previous versions has
          been ensured
        * Improved (inline) API documentation
        * Swapped urlparse with furl in saga.Url class This hopefully fixes
          the problem with inconsistent parsing accross different Python versions
        * Added SGE (Sun Grid Engine) plug-in (issue #11)
        * Removed sagacompat compatibility API
        * Log source names now all start with 'bliss.'. This should make
